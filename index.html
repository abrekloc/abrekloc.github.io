            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>I'm Abrek, a localization specialist. I help people to optimize and adapt their products and services globally.</p>
            <h2>Experience</h2>
            <p>Since 2018, I have been working with many agencies and customers to localize their games, products, services.
                I had the opportunity to work on the projects of leading companies and brands. Please contact me for more information.
            </p>

            <h2>Skills</h2>
            <p>As a localization specialist, I have a good understanding of the technical and business aspects of the products I work with
                such as the way they are created, function and marketed. I am always up to date with Web, Game and App development and localization trends.
                I also constantly improve my knowledge of digital marketing by following the latest developments about A/B testing, SEO, SEM, Brand Positioning, etc.
                Last but not least, I know the ins and outs of Translation Management Systems (TMS), Computer Assisted Translation (CAT) tools and Automated Quality Assurance (QA) systems.
